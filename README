Bao Framework (C) 2017 and beyond Bao.Bao@asia.com

Released under the MIT license. See LICENSE for details

Compiling:

This probject uses npm as its build system (after a request by a customer - yes someone is using it).


To build the framework:

npm install

	This will install the required tools


npm run build

	This will build the framework. The compiled code will be in node_modules/bao-framework


npm run clean

	This will delete the compiled files from the directory tree


Including the framework in other projects:

I've not thought about this much, but I think if you take the bao-framework directoy that is
created in the "node_modules" directory and dump it in the equivalent directory of your
project - it should maybe work.

An update, the framework is now in npmjs, the binary repo for the framework is at
https://github.com/BaoFramework/bao-framework
