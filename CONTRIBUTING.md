The code standard employed in this project is the:

"This is how I write code. This is how I've written code for the last 20 years. This is how I like code being written."

Coincidentally enough, it is very similar to http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/ with one exception, I am from the "tabs for indenting" family.

If you insist on indenting with spaces, feel free to contribute to another project.
